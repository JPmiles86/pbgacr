## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Data Entry Errors
- **Wrong Classification:** Ensure loan proceeds go to financing, not operating
- **Timing Errors:** Match cash flow timing, not accounting timing
- **Double Counting:** Avoid counting both gross and net amounts
- **Currency Mixing:** Keep consistent currency throughout

### Costa Rica Specific Mistakes
- **CCSS Timing:** Remember the one-month delay in payment timing
- **Tax Advances:** Don't forget quarterly payments, not just annual
- **VAT Netting:** Input VAT reduces output VAT liability
- **Free Zone Benefits:** Different cash flow patterns for free zone companies

### Projection Errors
- **Over-Optimism:** Conservative projections are more useful than optimistic ones
- **Ignoring Seasonality:** Historical patterns usually repeat
- **Static Assumptions:** Update projections monthly with new information
- **Inadequate Scenarios:** Always prepare for worse-case situations

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Template Formula Errors
```
Error: #REF!
Solution: Check if referenced cells were deleted. Restore from backup or recreate.

Error: #VALUE!
Solution: Verify all inputs are numbers, not text. Check for hidden characters.

Error: Circular Reference
Solution: Check if any cell refers to itself. Break the circular reference.
```

### Integration Issues
- **Bank Data Import:** Use CSV format, clean data before importing
- **Accounting System Export:** Map GL accounts consistently
- **Multi-Currency:** Use average rates for income/expense, closing rates for balance sheet

### Performance Optimization
- **Large Files:** Limit historical data to 24 months maximum
- **Slow Calculations:** Turn off automatic calculation during data entry
- **Memory Issues:** Close other applications, save frequently
